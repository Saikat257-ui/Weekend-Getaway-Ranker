# Weekend Getaway Ranker

A clean, explainable ranking system for weekend destinations in India, built strictly using the Kaggle dataset: **Guide to India's Must-See Places**.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

**Source**: [Kaggle - Travel Dataset: Guide to India's Must-See Places](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saketk511/travel-dataset-guide-to-indias-must-see-places)

## 🎯 Why Distance Was Approximated

Because the dataset does not provide exact distances, geographic proximity was approximated using **state-level grouping**, which is a reasonable heuristic for weekend travel planning.

### Proximity Approximation Logic

```
Same State        → Weight: 1.0  (Most suitable for weekend)
Neighboring State → Weight: 0.7  (Feasible for weekend)
Distant State     → Weight: 0.4  (Less ideal but possible)
```

This approach is justified because:
1. **Weekend trips are time-constrained** (2-3 days max)
2. **State boundaries correlate with travel time** in India
3. **Same-state destinations** typically require 2-6 hours of travel
4. **Neighboring states** are usually reachable within a day
5. **Distant states** require flights or long journeys

## 🧠 Weekend Suitability Logic

### Composite Score Formula

```python
weekend_score = 0.5 × rating_score + 0.3 × proximity_score + 0.2 × category_score
```
*Note: The weights were chosen to balance experience quality (ratings), travel feasibility (proximity), and weekend suitability (category), while keeping the logic simple and explainable.*

## 🔍 Assumptions & Constraints

### Assumptions Made

1. **State proximity = travel feasibility**: Reasonable for ground transportation in India
2. **Ratings reflect quality**: Higher-rated places provide better experiences
3. **Weekend = 2-3 days**: Standard Friday evening to Sunday night
4. **Source city exclusion**: Don't recommend destinations in the same city

### Constraints

1. **No real-time data**: Static dataset, no traffic/weather/season info
2. **No transportation modes**: Doesn't account for flights vs. trains vs. roads
3. **No cost consideration**: Dataset lacks pricing information
4. **No seasonal variation**: "Best time to visit" not factored (if present, could be added)
5. **Limited geographic precision**: State-level only, not city-to-city

## 🚧 Dataset Limitations

1. **Missing Distance Data**: Cannot calculate exact travel times
2. **No Accommodation Info**: Can't assess weekend stay feasibility
3. **No Cost Data**: Budget travelers vs. luxury seekers not differentiated
4. **Static Ratings**: May not reflect current conditions
5. **Incomplete Coverage**: May miss emerging destinations
6. **No Accessibility Info**: Doesn't account for road conditions, connectivity

## 📄 About the Sample Output Files

- The files in the sample_outputs/ directory are actual outputs generated by running ranker.py on the Kaggle dataset, not manually created examples.

- These files capture representative runs of the ranking algorithm for all of the different source cities(present in the CSV dataset) and are included so reviewers can quickly understand the system’s behavior without needing to execute the code themselves.

- All rankings, scores, and destination listings in these files are fully reproducible by running the script locally with the same dataset and configuration.


## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas library

### Installation

```bash

# Create and activate virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv

# After that activate it with this command:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # On Windows

# Then Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download dataset from Kaggle
# Place the csv file in data/ folder
```

### Verification

After placing the file, run:
```bash
python inspect_dataset.py
```

### Running the Ranker

```bash
python ranker.py
```

This will:
1. Load the dataset
2. Calculate weekend scores for randomly selected three cities present in the dataset
3. Display top 5 destinations for each city
4. Save results to `sample_outputs/` folder

### Output Format

Each output file contains:
- Source city and state
- Top 5 ranked destinations
- Location details (city, state)
- Category/type
- Rating
- Weekend score breakdown (proximity, rating, category components)


## 🔮 Future improvements (optional)

These are realistic next steps that would improve the recommendations if more data or time were available:

- **Distance & travel time:** A city-to-city distance matrix (Google Maps API or precomputed) can be used for real travel-time scores.  
- **Cost & logistics:** Incorporate accommodation/transport costs and travel mode to better rank feasibility.  
- **Seasonality & events:** Account for best months, weather, and major events/festivals.  
- **User preferences:** Allow weighting by traveler type (family, adventure, budget).  
- **Real-time signals:** Incorporate live weather, traffic, and hotel availability for time-sensitive recommendations.  
- **Advanced (future):** Learn weights from user feedback or try simple clustering for destination grouping.

*Note: All of the above require additional datasets or infra and are beyond the scope of this assignment.*

This project prioritizes **transparency over complexity** and **explainability over sophistication**—the hallmarks of production-ready data solutions.
